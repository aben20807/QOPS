# QCOR

QCOR is a C++ language extension and associated compiler implementation
for hybrid quantum-classical programming.

## Documentation

* [Documentation and User Guides](https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy)
* [Doxygen API Docs](https://ornl-qci.github.io/qcor-api-docs/)

## Installation
To install the `qcor` nightly binaries (for Mac OS X and Linux x86_64) run the following command from your terminal 
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/install.sh)"
```
To use the Python API, be sure to set your `PYTHONPATH`. 
For more details, see the [full installation documentation page](https://aide-qc.github.io/deploy/getting_started/).

### Docker Images

Nightly docker images are also available that serve up a [VSCode IDE](https://github.com/cdr/code-server) on port 8080. To use this image, run 
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 qcor/qcor
```
and navigate to ``https://localhost:8080`` in your browser to open the IDE and get started with QCOR. 

Alternatively, you could use the `qcor/cli` image providing simple command-line access to the `qcor` compiler. 
```bash
docker run -it qcor/cli
```
