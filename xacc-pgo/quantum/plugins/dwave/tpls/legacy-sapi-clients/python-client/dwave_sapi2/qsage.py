def solve_qsage(objfunc, num_vars, solver, solver_params, qsage_params):
    """
    answer = solve_qsage(objfunc, num_vars, solver, solver_params, qsage_params)
    (can be interrupted by Ctrl-C, will return the best solution found so far.)
    (for num_vars <= 10, the solve_qsage will do a brute-force search)

    solve_qsage tries to find the minimum of a pseudo-boolean function
    x = argmin_s f(s), s in {-1, 1}^N or {0, 1}^N where N is the number of variables.

    Args:
       objfunc: The implementation of the objective function f. solve_qsage assumes
                the following signature for f: y = f(s) where y is the returned
                objective value (y can be a list or tuple), s is a list of lists of states.

       num_vars: The number of variables.

       solver: solver that can solve ising problem. To be able to get the best performance,
               solver must be a sampler solver.

       solver_params: a dictionary of parameters for solver

       qsage_params: a dictionary of parameters for qsage algorithm, can use the following keys
                     (if the following parameter is set as None, it will use its default value):

              draw_sample: if set as False, solve_qsage will not draw samples, will only do tabu search
                           (must be a boolean, default = True)

              exit_threshold_value : if best value found by solve_qsage <= exit_threshold_value then exit
                                     (can be any number, default = float('-inf'))

              init_solution: the initial solution for the problem
                             (must be a list or tuple containing only -1/1 if "ising_qubo" parameter
                             is not set or set as "ising"; or 0/1 if "ising_qubo" parameter is
                             set as "qubo". The length of init_solution must be equal to num_vars,
                             default initial solution is randomly set)

              ising_qubo: "ising" or "qubo", if set as "ising", the return best solution will be -1/1;
                          if set as "qubo", the return best solution will be 0/1
                          (must be a string, default = "ising")

              lp_solver: a solver that can solve linear programming problems.
                     Finds the minimum of a problem specified by
                       min      f * x
                       st.      Aineq * x <= bineq
                                  Aeq * x = beq
                                  lb <= x <= ub

                     solve_qsage assumes the following signature for lp_solver:
                       x = solve(f, Aineq, bineq, Aeq, beq, lb, ub)

                       input arguments:

                                     f: linear objective function, a list (size: f_size)
                                     Aineq: linear inequality constraints, a list of lists (size: Aineq_size by f_size)

                                     ub: upper bounds, a list (size: f_size)

                       output arguments:
                                     x: solution found by the optimization function (size: f_size)

                     (if not provided a default solver is used)

              max_num_state_evaluations: the maximum number of state evaluations, if
                                         the total number of state evaluations >= max_num_state_evaluations

                                         (must be an integer >= 0, default = 50,000,000)

              random_seed: seed for random number generator that solve_qsage uses
                           (must be an integer >= 0, default is randomly set)

              timeout: timeout for solve_qsage (seconds)
                       (must be a number >= 0, default is approximately 10 seconds)

              verbose: control the output information
                   0: quiet
                   1, 2: different levels of verbosity
                   (must be an integer 0, or 1, or 2, default = 0)
                   when verbose is 1, the output information will be like:
                   [num_state_evaluations = ..., num_obj_func_calls = ..., num_solver_calls = ..., num_lp_solver_calls = ...],

                                            found so far and the current state found by tabu search
                   when verbose is 2, in addition to the output information when verbose is 1, the
